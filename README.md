## 📝 Interests
For study: I love VR&AR technology, for everyone should own the freedom to explore their life out of reality.\n
For life: I can play basic Tennis&table Tennis and enjoy that. Why basic? Because few friends have time for them.\n
For spirit: ACGN and philosophy. There should always be some places for love, thinking and fun, even if they are neither great nor sacred.\n

## 💻 The rest is on the way
